# Data Collection Module
![setup](headpose_setup.png)
- We use eSense earables from Nokia Bell Labs. More information about the earables are available here: https://www.esense.io/
- We use an in-house android app to collect IMU data from earables. The app is provided in this directory as ```esense.apk```. 
- We use sticky notes to place head-pose targets around the room. To find the azimuth angle, elevation angle and distance of the target from the spot where participants sit, we used a laser rangefinder (https://shop.leica-geosystems.com/buy/package/x3) and digital compass in smartphone.
- We setup six Optitrack Prime 13 cameras (https://optitrack.com/cameras/prime-13/) in the MoCap setup in conjunction with Motive:Tracker software (https://optitrack.com/software/motive/) to collect head-pose data. Please check the guide here on information about setting up the cameras and the software: https://v22.wiki.optitrack.com/index.php?title=Quick_Start_Guide:_Getting_Started
- We use laser pointers to guide the head-movements of participants. We also use ```Participant_Guide.pdf``` to provide written information to participants during data collection.
