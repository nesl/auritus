# Data Collection Module
![setup](headpose_setup.png)
- We use eSense earables from Nokia Bell Labs. More information about the earables and user guide are available here: https://www.esense.io/
- We use an in-house android app to collect IMU data from earables. The app is provided in this directory as ```esense.apk```. First, pair the earable you want to use with your smartphone via Bluetooth. Next, open the app, type the device name as it appeared when pairing, and press ```CONNECT TO DEVICE```. The app starts to log earable data. The data is stored in ```.csv``` format in ```Internal Storage/ESENSE_DATA/RAW_X.txt```. To stop logging data, click ```DISCONNECT FROM DEVICE```. To start logging data in a separate file, please close the app and reopen the app again.
- We use sticky notes to place head-pose targets around the room. To find the azimuth angle, elevation angle and distance of the targets from the spot where participants sit, we used a laser rangefinder (https://shop.leica-geosystems.com/buy/package/x3) and digital compass in smartphone. Please check the ```Dataset``` folder to find out the locations of the markers we used in our setup.
- We setup six Optitrack Prime 13 cameras (https://optitrack.com/cameras/prime-13/) in the MoCap setup in conjunction with Motive:Tracker software (https://optitrack.com/software/motive/) to collect head-pose data. Please check the guide here on information about setting up the cameras and the software: https://v22.wiki.optitrack.com/index.php?title=Quick_Start_Guide:_Getting_Started
- We use laser pointers to guide the head-movements of participants. We also use ```Participant_Guide.pdf``` to provide written information to participants during data collection.
